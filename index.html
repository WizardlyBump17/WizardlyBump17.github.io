            My name is Davi Henrique Linhares, but here on the internet I am known as WizardlyBump17.

            I was born in June 2005, in Brazil, and I became interested in programming in 2018.
            <br>
            In 2020, I became a freelancer at Senior Studios (now Premier Studios), and since then I have developed great projects for happy clients.
